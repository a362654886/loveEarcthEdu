    introduction: `<p>Our program is based on the advanced teaching experience from other countries. According to Birbalsingh, a commander in the education area of Britain recently recorded some of the best math results. "Math teachers from all around the world actually come to see what we do here and what surprised them is just old-fashioned - repeat, repeat, repeat - once they know it really well, you move to the next step.”(tvnz.co.nz, 2021)</p>

    <p>Our Mathematics programme is aimed to develop students’ mathematical abilities to the fullest may allow them to move faster. Therefore, our program will help students fill the gap between their real skills and ideal math skills, provide the necessary training and some repetitive work to help students build a strong foundation of math facts, which are not provided at many schools. In this way, if kids are moved onto the next year, they have completely mastered the previous year’s facts and foundation. They will feel very relaxed in math study and what's more important, their interests in math will be strengthen by their achievements.</p>
       
    <p>Some people may argue that the program will be too boring. However, for the parents who are paying attention to their kids’ education, they know that the elementary school do a lousy job with math. They would like to fill the math gap created by public education by adding extra necessary training in math. Our program can strengthen the math muscle by some necessary repetitive practice although it can be a little boring. Parents who understand the value of doing what is a tad dreary for a much bigger payoff down the road stick with it and cause their kids to stick with it too.</p>
       
    <p>Generally speaking, our bilingual math program will follow the national standard in Math teaching, but we do more than that. In order to mitigate the math learning barrier for young students, we evaluate every student’s math skill at the beginning of our program and design exclusive learning plan for every student. Through getting to know what they have learned at school, our teaching contents is flexible but relevant. In this way, the effects of repetition will be maximized and students’ math skills will be more solid. </p>
          
    <p>In addition, we find our target students in Chinese learning and the ones in Math learning may share some similarities, for example, the students of the two groups may be both very young and study at primary school, and their families may be both concerned with education very much. Therefore, bilingual math teaching, as our characteristic course, is provided if the young students want to try. The bilingual math course will distinguish our organization from the other participants in the same industry. </p>`,
    target:
      "<p>Our bilingual math program targets students who want to improve their math skills. Generally speaking, families who think math is important and where parents pay attention to education are much easier to accept the extra tutorial courses in math for their kids. We assume the children in families who concern education will be our major target students. To be specific, according to the International Mathematics and Science Study above, the students from year 5 to year 9 are one of the groups who have the high possibility in their math learning. In addition, we also encourage other students can join the program if they want to build a good math sense at a young age or they are not satisfied with what they learn from school and want to learn more in their spare time. Therefore, our target students are in a wide range in ages, basically they could be aged from 5-16.",

    introduction: `<p>Teachers in our college are those Chinese native speakers who can speak English quite well. Basically, they have good education backgrounds, have lived in NZ for more than 1 year at present and worked and lived in China for years in the past. They should have the multicultural backgrounds and understand well about the language differences in Chinese and English, the different ways of thinking underlying the cultural differences. In order to provide the most suitable and excellent teaching experience for different students, there are subtle different emphasis on the teachers for those 3 types of students. For young students, we prefer younger teachers (say 20’s) with the ability to keep the class attractive and energetic for children. For the adult students, teachers can be middle-aged (say 30’s) and we prefer they have working experience in China with some insights in the real business world of China. In this way, the potential needs for those students with business purpose in China's market can be met.</p>

    <p>The teachers adopt both online lessons and offline teaching. Offline lessons are mainly targeted for young students because they are easily distracted, and face-to-face learning is better for them to stay focused. Online lessons are mainly targeted to the adult students and other students who can arrange their time flexibly. Some workshops for the specific topic can be organized from time to time, which are decided by how many students are interested in.</p>
       
    <p>Apart from the lectures online and offline, in order to boost the motivation for Chinese learning, offline activities are organized occasionally. For example，activities can be organized on Chinese traditional festivals like spring festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival. The organizers will hold funny activities, competition, talent shows and prepare special Chinese food in order to boost students' learning enthusiasm, giving them insights into new ways of thinking, different beliefs and cultural practices. Meanwhile, various kinds of prizes are prepared for students’ participation which could be another encouragement as well.</p>
       `,
    target: `<p>We plan to target three types of the students for our Chinese Language Learning Programme. To be specific, they are young students (5-18 years old), adult students and others. 
 
      <p>1.Young students</p>
      <p>The students from primary school to high school are the first major group of our target students. Many parents want their children to start Chinese learning at their early ages，because it is well documented that a child’s ability to grasp new and multiple languages at an early age. Building the solid foundation for Chinese learning is what these young students concern about.</p>
       
      <p>2. Adult Students</p>
      <p>Adult students including university students and people who have business with Chinese are the second group. For university graduates, proficiency in Chinese is likely to become an increasingly useful asset and learning Chinese is a good way to promote their employability for them. For businesspeople who know Chinese language, it is also likely to boost their business prospects, particularly as more and more companies and organizations develop links and relationships with China.</p>
      <p>3.Others </p>
      <p>It refers to amateurs of Chinese and Chinese culture. These students may have some foundations in learning Chinese. They may have a wide range of interests in Chinese and the Chinese culture, for example, traditional culture, history, folk custom, Chinese food, Chinese entertainment, internet novels and so on.  </p>
