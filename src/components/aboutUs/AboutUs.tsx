        organizations. They have been planning activities such as Learning
        Chinese corner which is New Zealand first communication center of
        teaching people Mandarin and Cantonese. Different from Confucius
        Institute, which is mainly committed to Chinese learning for college
        students, we are committed to Chinese learning for the students in
        primary school, middle school and high school. Meanwhile, we have
        cooperated with government departments, helping senior officials learn
        Chinese. We did not apply for any grants, funding or state subsidies.
        Our slogan is: Learn Chinese and give back to the community and the
        world.
